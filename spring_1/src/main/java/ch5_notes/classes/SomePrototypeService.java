/*
* Prototype Scope is a way of creating unique Beans on demand of the same type, while using a single @Bean function or @Component class.
* The idea is that the every time you request a reference to a prototype-scoped bean, Spring creates a new object instance. 
* Spring manages the objectâ€™s type and creates a new instance every time someone requests a reference to the bean - The beans are all unique, so we no
* longer have concurency issues!

* Caveat: The created instances are PARTIALLY managed by the spring context. Meaning, on creation, Spring takes care of them, injecting dependencies and 
* calling stuff like @PostConstruct, but after that the instances are on their own. Spring no longer manages those instances!
